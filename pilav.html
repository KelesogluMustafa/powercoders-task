    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of rice (baldo or arborio), 450 g</li>
      <li>1/2 cup orzo (şehriye), 100 g</li>
      <li>50 g butter + 1 tbsp oil (olive, sunflower or canola) <br>or 60 g clarified butter (ghee)</li>
      <li>3 cups beef stock (boiling), approx. 650 ml</li>
      <li>3 tsp salt (adjust based on saltiness of stock)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak the rice in water with 1 tsp salt. Stir and let it sit for 10–15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
      <li>Wash and rinse the rice 3–4 times until water runs completely clear.</li>
      <li>Drain the rice in a strainer and let it dry until nearly moisture-free.</li>
      <li>Bring the stock to a boil and keep it simmering on low heat to stay hot.</li>
      <li>In a wide pan with a tight lid, melt 60 g clarified butter (or 50 g butter + 1 tbsp oil) over medium heat. The oil prevents burning; clarified butter won’t burn easily.</li>
      <li>Add the orzo and stir until evenly golden brown and the butter is bubbly.</li>
      <li>Once browned, add the drained rice and gently stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Add 2 tsp salt (adjust depending on saltiness of stock).</li>
      <li>Fry the rice for about 5 minutes until it becomes translucent and pearl-like. Stir constantly and gently to avoid breaking the grains.</li>
      <li>Pour the hot stock into the pot. Stir once gently.</li>
      <li>Once it starts to boil, immediately reduce heat to the lowest setting.</li>
      <li>Cover with lid and let it cook for 10 minutes, until liquid is fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>Open the lid and fluff gently with a spatula from bottom to top to evenly mix the layers.</li>
      <li>Place a clean cloth or paper towel between the pot and the lid to absorb steam and excess moisture.</li>
      <li>Let it rest with lid closed for another 10–15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
